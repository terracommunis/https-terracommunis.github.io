# Plannning London Datahub
## Project Structure and Methodology

### Objectives
- Organize and clean Planning London Datahub (PLD) data to ensure consistency and quality across datasets.
- Restructure and summarize the data for enhanced usability and integration with visualization tools.
- Generate transparent and informative data representations to reveal underlying patterns and insights.

### Tools and Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning, organization, and restructuring of the raw PLD data.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Used for generating clear and informative visualizations to highlight trends and patterns within the data.
- **Tableau**: Enabled the creation of interactive visualizations and dashboards, facilitating user-friendly data exploration and analysis.

### Step-by-Step Data Processing Workflow
- **Data Cleaning**: Identified and addressed inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting errors to ensure data reliability.
- **Data Restructuring**: Reorganized data into structured tables with relevant attributes to facilitate efficient analysis.
- **Summarization**: Created summary tables and metrics to condense large volumes of data, making it easier to extract actionable insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Developed visualizations to represent key metrics and patterns, making insights more accessible for decision-makers.

### Challenges Encountered
- **Data Inconsistency**: The PLD data contained various inconsistencies and incomplete records, requiring thorough cleaning to ensure accuracy.
- **Complex Data Relationships**: Handling interdependencies between data fields required careful restructuring and validation to avoid misinterpretation.
- **Visualization Integration**: Integrating cleaned data with visualization tools in a meaningful way required iterative testing to ensure clarity.

### Insights and Benefits
- The organized and cleaned PLD data provided a transparent and accurate foundation for analysis, facilitating more effective decision-making.
- Visualizations made it easier to identify trends, correlations, and potential issues, supporting proactive planning.
- The process resulted in a streamlined dataset that can be consistently updated, ensuring ongoing relevance and usability for future analyses.
