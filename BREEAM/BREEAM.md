## Methodology
The study employs a comprehensive methodology encompassing data extraction, cleaning, analysis, and visualization to achieve its objectives. The following sections outline the detailed processes involved:

### 1. Data Collection

#### Web-Scraping Process
The data extraction process involved sophisticated web scraping techniques with **Python** to retrieve BREEAM certification data from the GreenBookLive database. Given the website's dynamic nature, a combination of HTTP requests and browser automation via Selenium was employed to effectively interact with and extract data from dynamically loaded content.

#### Python Libraries:
    - `requests` for handling HTTP requests and fetching static content.
    - `lxml` for parsing HTML and extracting data fields.
    - `Selenium` with the Chrome WebDriver for automating browser interactions and handling JavaScript-rendered content.
    - `Pandas` for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
    - `Folium` and `GeoPandas` for geospatial analysis and visualization.

#### Web Scraping Implementation:
Implementation Steps:

1. Selenium Configuration: Selenium WebDriver was configured with headless Chrome options to automate browser interactions without a graphical interface.
2. Page Navigation: Automated scripts navigated through multiple pages of the GreenBookLive database, handling pagination controls to ensure comprehensive data collection.
3. Data Extraction: Relevant data fields such as building name, location, certification date, certification level, and assessor information were identified and extracted from the HTML content using `lxml`.
4. Data Storage: The extracted data was initially stored in CSV files for intermediate storage and later imported into Pandas DataFrames for further processing.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Processing
Once the raw data was collected, extensive preprocessing was necessary to ensure accuracy and consistency, enabling reliable analysis.
#### Data Cleaning:
- **Duplicate Removal**: Redundant entries were eliminated using Pandas' drop_duplicates() function.
- **Standardizing Location Formats**: Inconsistent region names were standardized using mapping dictionaries (e.g., converting "N.W. England" to "North West England") to ensure uniformity across the dataset.
- **Date Format Standardization**: All certification dates were converted to a consistent YYYY-MM-DD format using Pandas' to_datetime() function, with erroneous entries coerced to NaT (Not a Time) and subsequently handled.
- **Handling Missing Data**:
    - **Imputation**: Missing geographical data were imputed based on known regional clusters of BREEAM-certified buildings. For categorical fields, mode substitution was applied where appropriate.
    - **Exclusion**: Records with critical missing fields, such as location or certification level, were excluded from specific analyses to maintain data integrity.
      
#### Categorization:
- **Building Type**: To facilitate sectoral analysis, buildings were classified into categories, including Residential, Commercial, Public Infrastructure, Industrial, and Others.
- **Region**: Data was grouped based on UK regions (e.g., London, Scotland, North West) to enable regional comparative studies.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within the BREEAM certifications dataset.

#### Temporal Trends:

- **Analysis:** Time-series analysis tracked annual changes in certification counts over the past five years.

- **Visualization:** Line charts illustrated the upward trend in certifications, particularly highlighting increases in higher certification levels during periods of significant regulatory changes.
