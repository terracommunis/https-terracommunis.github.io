# Topo from Satellite imagery

## Project Structure and Methodology

### Objectives
- Extract and process satellite imagery from JAXA to generate accurate topographic data for use in Rhino.
- Utilize QGIS for geospatial processing and manipulation to prepare data for Rhino compatibility.
- Create detailed topography models in Rhino for visualization and project analysis purposes.

### Tools and Libraries Used
- **JAXA Satellite Imagery**: Acquired high-resolution satellite images from the Japanese Space Agency to capture topographic information.
- **QGIS**: Used to process, manipulate, and export terrain data from satellite images in formats suitable for Rhino.
- **Rhino and Grasshopper**: Imported the processed topography data into Rhino for detailed modeling and analysis, with Grasshopper used for further customization.

### Step-by-Step Data Processing Workflow
- **Data Extraction**: Obtained satellite images with topographic information from JAXAâ€™s data repository.
- **Data Processing in QGIS**: Processed and converted the satellite images into Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) or contour data, ensuring accurate elevation representation.
- **Exporting for Rhino**: Exported the processed terrain data from QGIS in formats compatible with Rhino (e.g., DXF, SHP, or XYZ) for seamless integration.
- **Topography Modeling in Rhino**: Imported the topographic data into Rhino, categorizing it into layers for terrain, contours, and elevation points, enabling detailed 3D modeling.
- **Customization in Grasshopper**: Used Grasshopper to further refine and adjust the topography model, allowing for custom analyses and project-specific modifications.

### Challenges Encountered
- **Data Resolution**: Ensuring the satellite data resolution was high enough to capture detailed topography for accurate Rhino modeling.
- **Data Conversion**: Converting DEM or raster data from QGIS into formats compatible with Rhino required careful processing to maintain topographic accuracy.
- **Layer Management**: Organizing complex terrain data in Rhino required efficient layer management to handle different elevation points, contours, and terrain features.

### Insights and Benefits
- This workflow provided a cost-effective way to generate accurate topography models for early-stage project analysis, avoiding the need for traditional surveying.
- Using satellite data from JAXA ensured a high level of detail and coverage, making it possible to create realistic terrain models for remote or challenging regions.
- The integration with Rhino allowed for flexible visualization, enabling customized terrain analysis and enhancing project presentations.
